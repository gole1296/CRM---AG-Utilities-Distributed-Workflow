# AG Utilities - by Alberto Gemini

This is a rehost of an older solution that is currently archived on CodePlex. It contains solutions for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 - 2015 that allow you to run workflows on 1:N and N:N relationships. All credit for this solution goes to the original author, and I will not be updating any of the components. 

Administrators running Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016 or 365 should be able to find this functionality in other solutions that are still being updated and supported by their authors. I have put this here to help those who are still running older versions of CRM and have not had the chance to update yet.

For ideas or guides on how to use this functionality, you can check out my website:  [The Functional CRM Admin](https://functional-crm-admin.weebly.com/)
